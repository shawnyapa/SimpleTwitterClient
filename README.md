Simple Twitter Client - CodePath Android BootCamp Week 3 Project

Project Completed
Hours Spent: Considering how few optionals I've finished, I'm embarrassed to admit... a lot. A lot of time on some really trivial stuff. 

*Sigh* And the UI still looks terrible.

Required Stories Completed:
 - User can sign in to Twitter using OAuth login
 - User can view the tweets from their home timeline
 - User should be displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
 - User should be displayed the relative timestamp for each tweet "8m", "7h"
 - User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination
 - User can compose a new tweet
 - User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
 - User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
 - User is taken back to home timeline with new tweet visible in timeline
 - Optional: User can see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet
 - Option: Pull to Refresh

The item I'm going back to work on now is Active Android.
